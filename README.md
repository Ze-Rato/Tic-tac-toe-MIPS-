# Tic-tac-toe
A failed attemp at a less than 100 lines tic tac toe on assembly. 
It works on mars, not sure if it would on an unemulated environment. On summer I'll probably have time to improve this and go down the 100 barrier.

No upadtes till summer neither commented version yet since I do belive this could be improved.
